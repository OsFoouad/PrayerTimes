<h1>Prayer Times</h1>
<p>
Islamic App give you the pray times , Current Place , Qiblah Direction
in this app i implment the Dark mode for first time in Flutter and used provider state managment to handle it also here we fetch data from API provided by "https://aladhan.com/" and the times appear is duo to the api not my code as i noticed a difference in some pray times .
this app also cover the area of upcomming pray as i compare current time in phone with the times retrived using DIO from api and detect next pray and how many hours and minutes untill it .
in the bottom you can find a Circular shape  of The Greatest place on the earth "Qiblah" -pray for us to visit it soon- this icon move you to another screen this screen have moveable compass which tell you the qiblah direction "where to face while pray". also this screen tells you on which angle the Qiblah from your current place.

i hope this may be have your interest.

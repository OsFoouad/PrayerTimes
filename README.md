<h1>Prayer Times</h1>
<p>
Islamic App give you the pray times 
untill now it give according to Cairo city only but next step to detect your location and get your times if you away from cairo.
the app support dark mode and light mode , i used provider state mangment to handle this option.
i used tween animation to move the back rectangle from left and right and this give the app beauty shape.

the next steps will be handle no connection result ,  detect the current location and give you the times for your place <3
